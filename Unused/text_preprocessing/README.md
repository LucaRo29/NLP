#Issues: 
Can't import: \
```from spellchecker import SpellChecker```

Line 160: \
Do not have a ```chat_words_list``` - but should not be that relevant for E-Mail spam detection!

Installation Setup: 
I am using python 3.7 
and SpaCy 2.3.0 
I manually installed spellchecker with: ```pip install pyspellchecker```
All other packages have been installed as suggested in pyCharm
